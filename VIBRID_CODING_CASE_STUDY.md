## üîç Detailed Code Evolution Analysis

### Example: Storage Implementation Evolution

**Initial Electron Implementation:**
```javascript
// Used Node.js filesystem for data persistence
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
```

**Browser Vibrid Implementation:**
```javascript
// Seamless pivot to browser localStorage with same functionality
class BrowserStorageManager {
    constructor() {
        this.storageKey = 'shelfTalkerData';
        this.entries = this.loadEntries();
    }
    
    saveEntry(entry) {
        // Professional validation and error handling
        if (!entry.title || !entry.author || !entry.description) {
            throw new Error('All fields (title, author, description) are required');
        }
        // Robust implementation continues...
    }
}
```

### Example: Export Feature Enhancement

**Original Requirement:** Basic clipboard copy
**Vibrid Implementation:** Multiple export formats with fallback strategies

```javascript
// HTML-based Word document export - corporate security compliant
function handleExportDocx() {
    const htmlContent = `
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <style>
        /* Professional print-optimized styling */
        @media print { @page { size: landscape; } }
        table { border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; }
        td { padding: 15px; border: 1px solid #666; min-height: 1in; }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Print-ready table format for shelf talker cutting -->
</body>
</html>`;
    
    // Self-contained blob creation without external dependencies
    const blob = new Blob([htmlContent], { type: 'text/html' });
}
```
